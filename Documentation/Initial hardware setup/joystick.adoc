= Joystick

Last updated 10 May 2019

== Installation
Follow this link for complete instructions on how to interface the joystick with ROS:
http://wiki.ros.org/joy/Tutorials/ConfiguringALinuxJoystick

WARNING: No need to download any package except those defined in the link above. Else, it may cause conflicts that can be very difficult to resolve (had to reinstall Ubuntu).

== Notes
- The Logitech F710 and Xbox One Controller have some differences in the output. Be careful of which one you are using.
- The Xbox One seems to have difficulty connecting wirelessly to Ubuntu 16.04. We are using it in `wired` mode for our system.
- The Logitech F710 has no issues in connecting wirelessly to Ubuntu. However, we are wary of using it due to effective range / line-of-sight blocking between the receiver and the joystick.

== Useful Commands
roscore +
rosparam set joy_node/dev "/dev/input/js0" +
rosrun joy joy_node  +
rostopic echo joy +
